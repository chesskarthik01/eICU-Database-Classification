# eICU-Database-Classification
Creating a classification neural network using keras for the eICU demo patient dataset.
<br> Dataset obtained from https://physionet.org/content/eicu-crd-demo/2.0/
<br> Tensorflow 2.0 used to support keras
<br> Externally viewing the notebook in binder will render it slightly better, only the interactive plots made using cufflinks won't be visible.
